# reinforcement-learning-cheat-sheet
As part of my master thesis in reinforcement learning, I am gradually putting most of the basic notations all the way to the popular state-of-art methods in one place. Any suggestion or contribution is welcome :

## To Do 
* Basic notations
* Problem setup
* Policy gradient methods
* Policy gradient vs Value-based
* TD
* SARSA
* On-policy vs off-policy
* Dynamic programming
* DQN
* Double DQN
* Priority replay
* A3C
* Distributed DQN
* Noisy DQN
* Recurrent DQN
* Dueling Arch
* Experience replay
